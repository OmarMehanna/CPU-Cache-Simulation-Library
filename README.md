# CPU-Cache-Simulation-Library
Extended the CPU Cache Simulation Library to enhance cache memory module functionality. I performed debugging to resolve issues and improved the codebase's performance. Extensive testing was conducted to ensure reliable operation, focusing on simulating cache behaviors, measuring misses, and optimizing cache operations.
